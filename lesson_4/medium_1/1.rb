Ben asked Alyssa to code review the following code:

=end
class BankAccount
  attr_reader :balance

  def initialize(starting_balance)
    @balance = starting_balance
  end

  def positive_balance?
    balance >= 0
  end
end
=begin

Alyssa glanced over the code quickly and said - "It looks fine, except that you forgot to put the @ before balance when you refer to the balance instance variable in the body of the positive_balance? method."

"Not so fast", Ben replied. "What I'm doing here is valid - I'm not missing an @!"

Who is right, Ben or Alyssa, and why?

=end

# Ben is right, as balance is a getter method, due to the inclusion of
# attr_reader for the balance instance variable.
